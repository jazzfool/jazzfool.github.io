- 20 minute read</p><h1 class=entry-title><a href=/post/phenotune/>Reconstructing music with genetic algorithms</a></h1></header><p>Introduction I&rsquo;ve been listening to Prefuse 73 and Pogo lately, who are electronic music producers defined by their aggressive use of track sampling in order to create melody and harmony, rather than taking the more &ldquo;direct&rdquo; approach of sampling individual instruments. This creates for very stylistic music where you can almost hear the individual brush strokes of sound - this song a great example of this.
I&rsquo;ve also been looking at some cool projects that perform image/video reconstruction built off of simpler shapes, using a genetic algorithm.</p><footer><a href=/post/phenotune/ rel=full-article>Read On &rarr;</a></footer></article><article><header><p class=meta>Feb 10, 2022

This works, but is an ugly solution which doesn&rsquo;t look good with large outline widths, and was locked to a single outline color and width globally. It also lacked anti-aliasing as it was a post-process pass presumably running after FXAA.
This new method solves these issues, and is also more performant.</p><footer><a href=/post/godot-outlines-pt2/ rel=full-article>Read On &rarr;</a></footer></article><article><header><p class=meta>Feb 9, 2022

Outlines are a handy visual tool in games to show focus on objects. Unfortunately for Godot, I haven&rsquo;t seen much content on how to make nice looking outlines for 3D objects.
This guide will show you how to make outlines that look like this:
Step 1: Isolating depth Firstly, we need to isolate the depth for the objects we want to outline.</p><footer><a href=/post/godot-outlines/ rel=full-article>Read On &rarr;</a></footer></article><article><header><p class=meta>Aug 1, 2021

It abides by what most already know of object-oriented programming and manually mutated states. By far the biggest advantage of such an API is its clarity; there is nothing to learn or understand as what you write is exactly what you mean.

I&rsquo;m disappointed by what I&rsquo;ve seen as I&rsquo;ve worked with a vast palette of desktop GUI solutions. Everything from Qt to Electron have their own hideous limbs with their very own creative ways burden you as you develop your app. That isn&rsquo;t to discredit them all, as a few actually offer wonderful developer experiences (though often still lacking in practicality and applicability).</p><footer><a href=/post/gui/ rel=full-article>Read On &rarr;</a></footer></article></div><aside class="sidebar thirds"><section class="first odd"><p></p></section><ul class=sidebar-nav><li class=sidebar-nav-item></li></ul></aside></div></div><footer role=contentinfo><p>Copyright &copy; 2023 jazzfool - <a href=/license/>License</a> -
